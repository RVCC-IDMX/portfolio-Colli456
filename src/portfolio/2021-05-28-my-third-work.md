At the time of writing this, this is my latest work. This is another project that I wrote in codepen, I was participating in the #CodePenChallenge of creating a unique layout. For this challenge I was using a CSS Grid layout to create a card gallery while continuing my journey of using codepen. It was my first experience with Pug (as an HTML templating language), reset and normalize. As well as practicing using Modern CSS techniques.
