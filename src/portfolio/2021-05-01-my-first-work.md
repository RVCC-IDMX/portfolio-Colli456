This was one of my first works when starting my web development course. I was creating a page that required a public domain poem and an appropriate image to go with it. I was learning how to use Sass and getting familiar with it while also getting familiar with Open Props and practicing styling BEM classes. It was also one of the first times I deployed a site using Netlify. I referenced it from an example shown to me by my professor.
